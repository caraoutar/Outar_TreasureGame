Hi Karina!

Few notes:

- The new jump control is the 'S' key now instead of 'W'. 

- I'm dealing with a weird bug issue where after the player views the sign on the first level (w/ the pop-up text), they aren't able to jump. To fix this, you have to move all the way to the edge of the screen where the grey floor is and then you should be able to jump again to reach the cloud platforms. Sorry about this, will look into fixing it for the final! 

- I know the game is pretty disorienting as of now with the camera flip, I'm going to work on how I can use a flipped camera in a way that doesn't feel so bad visually. Everything is upright in the actual Unity editor though so in case things get too confusing please look at that! I also need to work on the floor openings being more clear to the player, since right now it's a little unclear where they should be going, but you should be able to see in the editor where the floor object has been destroyed!
